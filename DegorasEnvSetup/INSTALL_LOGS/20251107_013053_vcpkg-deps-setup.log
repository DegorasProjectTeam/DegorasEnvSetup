A suitable version of powershell-core was not found (required v7.5.3).
Downloading https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v7.5.3/PowerShell-7.5.3-win-x64.zip -> PowerShell-7.5.3-win-x64.zip
error: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v7.5.3/PowerShell-7.5.3-win-x64.zip: WinHttpSetOption failed with exit code 87.
note: If you are using a proxy, please ensure your proxy settings are correct.
Possible causes are:
1. You are actually using an HTTP proxy, but setting HTTPS_PROXY variable to `https//address:port`.
This is not correct, because `https://` prefix claims the proxy is an HTTPS proxy, while your proxy (v2ray, shadowsocksr, etc...) is an HTTP proxy.
Try setting `http://address:port` to both HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY instead.
2. If you are using Windows, vcpkg will automatically use your Windows IE Proxy Settings set by your proxy software. See: https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/pull/77
The value set by your proxy might be wrong, or have same `https://` prefix issue.
3. Your proxy's remote server is out of service.
If you believe this is not a temporary download server failure and vcpkg needs to be changed to download this file from a different location, please submit an issue to https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/issues
